I present here the cartography & data analysis code I developed as part of a project led by Antoine PARENT and Pablo JENSEN, in the context of the IXXI Complexity and Cliometrics team. This project aims to quantify the process of economic polarisation having arguably followed the onset of neoliberal policies since the 1980s, and help expose the causal relations between globalisation and the development of territorial inequalities.
